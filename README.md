# Permit Web Scraping

This project uses selenium to do some basic web scraping and then finishes with some data processing. This was created to automate a manual data mining process they had at my company.

This project is not finished. The final step is to implement a machine learning or more likely deep learning solution to accurately get the system size (kWh) from the project description field of the permits because the simple logic based approach is not entirely accurate -- at least to the necessary standards.
